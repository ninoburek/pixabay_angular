Pixabay api :)


Just a simple Angular.js Pixabay appi to get 'Beatifull yellow flowers" images.
Next version should have input field for searching all images.
Yellow flowers are nice but I'am sure you want more :)

Paging is simplified to next/previous page only.. next version with page numbers.

Don't forget to change Pixabay api key in
